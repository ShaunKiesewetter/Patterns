# Composite Design Pattern

The composite pattern is a design pattern that is used when creating hierarchical object models. 
The pattern defines a manner in which to design recursive tree structures of objects, where individual objects and 
groups can be accessed in the same manner.

An example use of the composite pattern is for representing management structures in an organisation. In such a structure, 
each employee object can be the manager with zero or more subordinates. Contractors who are also workers but do not have reports
represent the  leaf nodes in this design.
